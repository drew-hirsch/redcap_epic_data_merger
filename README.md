# REDCap‚ÄìEpic Patient Data Merger

This Python script merges patient data from two separate Excel/CSV spreadsheets:

1. **REDCap report** (must be selected first)
2. **CS-Link/Epic export** (must be selected second)

The script matches patients based on **First Name**, **Last Name**, and **Appointment Date**, and intelligently handles slight differences in name spelling by using a fuzzy matching algorithm (4+ consecutive matching letters). Only rows from the **REDCap spreadsheet** are included in the final output, with matching diagnosis and cognitive data pulled in from Epic.

## üöÄ Features

- üß† Fuzzy name matching (4-letter consecutive match)
- üìÖ Robust date format standardization
- üîó Combines $Dx Code$ and $Cognitive Impairment$ fields (semicolon-separated)
- üßπ Keeps only REDCap patient records
- üßæ Capitalizes names for cleaner output
- üíæ Outputs merged file as `merged.csv`


## Requirements

- Python 3.7 or later
- `pandas` and `openpyxl` libraries

## How to Run the Script

1. **Open Terminal (macOS) or Command Prompt (Windows).**

2. **Navigate to the folder where your `merger.py` script is saved.**

- On **Windows**, if your script is in `C:\Users\YourName\Documents\`: cd C:\Users\YourName\Documents


- On **macOS**, if your script is in `/Users/yourname/Documents/`: cd /Users/yourname/Documents


3. **Run the script:**

- On **Windows**:
``
python merger.py
``

- On **macOS**:
``
python3 merger.py
``

4. A file dialog window will open. Select your REDCap CSV or Excel file.

5. The script will create a new file with the same name but ending with `_merged.csv` in the same folder.

## Example

Before (multiple rows per patient):

| Record ID | Repeat Instrument      | First Name | Last Name | Age | DOB     |
|-----------|------------------------|------------|-----------|-----|---------|
| 125       |                        | John       | Doe       |     |         |
| 125       | Survey                 |            |           | 52  | 4/12/53 |
| 125       | Patient Assessments    |            |           |     |         |

After (merged into one row):

| Record ID | Repeat Instrument | First Name | Last Name | Age | DOB     |
|-----------|-------------------|------------|-----------|-----|---------|
| 125       | Survey            | John       | Doe       | 52  | 4/12/53 |

## Notes

- Your input file must contain a column named exactly: `Record ID`
- Column headers with extra spaces will be cleaned automatically
- Output file is saved in the same folder as the input file
- If reading Excel files, `openpyxl` is required

# REDCap‚ÄìEpic Patient Data Merger

This Python script merges patient data from two separate Excel/CSV spreadsheets:

1. **REDCap report** (must be selected first)
2. **CS-Link/Epic export** (must be selected second)

The script matches patients based on **First Name**, **Last Name**, and **Appointment Date**, and intelligently handles slight differences in name spelling by using a fuzzy matching algorithm (4+ consecutive matching letters). Only rows from the **REDCap spreadsheet** are included in the final output, with matching diagnosis and cognitive data pulled in from Epic.
